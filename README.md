# ERC-20: Token Standard

[ERC-20](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-20) is a technical standard used for smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain for implementing tokens. ERC stands for Ethereum Request for Comment, and 20 is the number that was assigned to this request. The clear purpose of the ERC-20 standard is to ensure that all tokens released on the Ethereum blockchain will be compatible with the wallets, exchanges, and other smart contracts that also use the same standard.

This repository is part of the `Advanced Foundry` course given by Cyfrin Updraft [here](https://updraft.cyfrin.io/courses/advanced-foundry/).

The implementation of the ERC-20 standard is done in the `src` directory and is using [ERC-20](https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/5.x/erc20) contract from OpenZeppelin. The `test` directory contains the tests for the ERC-20 implementation.
